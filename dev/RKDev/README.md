I created this dev folder as a place for devleopers to put notes/scripts/settings etc. that are specific to a devlopment project.
The idea is to have any custom enviroment things/personal notes that are specific to a project to be held in the github so that a project
can be downloaded to any computer and have all of a developer's customizations available to them.
