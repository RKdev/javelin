# Javelin.js #

Javelin is a flexible game engine written in javascript, for browser and server.

When major refactoring is done, there will be more decent documentation here.

This README will be about developing on Javelin, not how to use it in a game - that information will be on the GHPages site - which is generated by gulp tasks in this repo.

## Developing ##

* Check out project
* run `npm install` in this directory
* use the gulp tasks to build the project, and perform other tasks:
    * `gulp build` - builds the main project into `build/javelin/`
    * `gulp docs` - builds the documentation site locally, and serves it from `http://localhost:8080`
    * `gulp watch:javelin` - to rebuild, lint and test everything in `build/javelin/` when code in `src/` changes
    * `gulp watch:docs` - to rebuild the local docs site when anything in `src/` or `demos/` changes
    * `gulp -T` - to show available tasks
