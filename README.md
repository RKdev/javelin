# Javelin.js #

Javelin is a flexible game engine written in javascript, for browser and server.

When major refactoring is done, there will be more decent documentation here.

This README will be about developing on Javelin, not how to use it in a game - that information will be on the GHPages site - which is generated by grunt tasks in this repo.
