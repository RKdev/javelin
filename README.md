# Javelin.js #

Javelin is a flexible game engine written in javascript, for browser and server.

When major refactoring is done, there will be more decent documentation here.

This README will be about developing on Javelin, not how to use it in a game - that information will be on the GHPages site - which is generated by grunt tasks in this repo.

## Developing ##

* Check out project
* run `npm install` in this directory
* use the grunt tasks to build the project, and perform other tasks:
    * `grunt build` - builds the main project into `build/javelin/`
    * `grunt javelin-docs` - builds a documentation site locally, and serves it from `127.0.0.1:8555`
    * `grunt -h` - to list other available tasks
    * `grunt watch:javelin` - to rebuild everything in `build/javelin/` when code in `src/` changes
    * `grunt watch:docs` - to rebuild the local docs site when anything in `src/` or `demos/` changes
